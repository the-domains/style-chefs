* When planning an event, there are many factors you have to take
into consideration.
* Location,
time of year, the cost, who will be attending, what you want to give your
guests, and the impressions they take away with them.
* ****

**I try my hardest to give a realistic, do-able solution
to any event.**
* Whether
be it in a remote area, at your client's home/office - or in a luxury location,
you have to always to stay fresh, original and, just a little bit crazy.
* With
many years of working for Hotels, Restaurants, and big Catering firms. I can
proudly say that my Rucksack is full of ideas, solutions and menu driven
inspirational-hand designed dishes that are effective, fresh, and deliver on
visual stimulation as well as sensory stimulation.
* ****

**Remember when they
"speak about you "they are based on memories and lasting
impressions**
* ****

**Cooking is a Science and an art, and the man who puts
all his heart into satisfying his fellow men deserves consideration**

**-Auguste Escoffier-**

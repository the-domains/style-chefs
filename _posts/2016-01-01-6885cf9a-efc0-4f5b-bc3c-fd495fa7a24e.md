Sakura

Sakura Mix is a mix for connoisseurs, combining a number of recognizable and pronounced flavours. The various cress varieties in the Sakura Mix give you plenty of options. Borage Cress goes well with fish. The flavour of Tahoon Cress is perfect in combination with game or wild mushrooms. Rock Chives have an intense garlic flavour but without the 'garlic effect'. Sakura Cress and Daikon Cress are varieties with a peppery radish flavour. You can use them together or individually with meat or raw fish. Mustard Cress, with its sharp mustard flavour, is very versatile.
